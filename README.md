# README #

This repository contains a pristine boilerplate with recommended settings for a new browser application. It is intended to 
be forked and used as a starting point for new applications. Any tweaks to configuration can then be pulled from upstream if required.

This template uses Vite to manage building and configuring the application. You can read more about Vite here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/

### How do I get set up? ###

* Fork the repository
* Run 'yarn dev' to run the project in your new repo.
* From that point on you may build out the application you need.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Ensure any changes are very targeted and do not affect the boilerplate too much. (Consider the impact on other projects that may be using this boilerplate.)
